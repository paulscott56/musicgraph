/**
 * Localised names
 * 
 * The locale should be used to capture the official name as normally used in a particular language and/or country.
 * An artist can only have one localised name for each locale. 
 * If there is more than one, use the most recent name for an artist. 
 * If multiple names are used in an interchangeable manner, use the most common one. 
 * Other names can still be added as aliases without a locale.
 * 
 * The locale should not be more specific than it needs to be, so the country should only be included when necessary, 
 * e.g. If an artist name is the same in all English speaking countries, "English" with no country is sufficient. 
 * If the name is normally the same, but is different (usually for legal reasons) in certain countries, 
 * then the country should only be used to identify where the name is different from the usual name for that language.
 * 
 * Examples
 * Пётр Ильич Чайковский is known as "Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky" in English.
 * The Beatles are known as "ザ・ビートルズ" in Japanese.
 * Yazoo are normally known as "Yazoo" in English, but are known as "Yaz" in English in the United States. 
 * 
 * When to use aliases
 * 
 * There are many cases where using aliases is appropriate:
 * 
 * Misspellings:
 * These are the most common, and function as a simplistic automatic spelling corrector
 * e.g. Led Zepplin = Led Zeppelin
 * 
 * Variants:
 * An artist may use several similar names interchangeably without making a distinction, from release to release
 * e.g. Hootie and the Blowfish = Hootie & the Blowfish; Monty Python's Flying Circus = Monty Python
 * 
 * Numbers:
 * Even if the artist prefers spelled out or numerical form, they may or may not be spelled out by users
 * e.g. The 3 Tenors = The Three Tenors
 * 
 * Stylized Names:
 * Many artists feel a need to spell their names with strange spacing, odd characters and punctuation, etc.
 * e.g. NSync = 'N Sync
 * 
 * Missing Titles:
 * Artists add or drop titles, monikers and/or articles from their names
 * e.g. The Sex Pistols = Sex Pistols; Tiësto = DJ Tiësto; Cheb Khaled = Khaled
 * 
 * Acronyms:
 * Artists with long and unwieldy names are often better known by their acronyms, and may use them on their release covers
 * e.g. B.D.P. = BDP = Boogie Down Productions
 * 
 * Initials:
 * Overlaps somewhat with acronyms, but there are sometimes middle initials not generally used in the artist's name
 * e.g. J.S. Bach = Johann Sebastian Bach
 * 
 * Incomplete Names:
 * When credited as "Strauss", it's usually Johan Strauss II and not Richard or one of the others that is intended
 * e.g. Strauss = Johann Strauss II
 * 
 * Lead Performers:
 * Sting is a member of The Police - it is not a collaboration, and the band does not officially include his name in theirs, 
 * however compilations often list featured members explicitly by name in this way
 * e.g. Sting & The Police = The Police
 * 
 * Misencodings:
 * Artist names entered in FreeDB using non-UTF-8 encodings; these are somewhat like typos, but in non-Unicode locales, 
 * these may in fact be more accurate than an automatic conversion from UTF-8
 * e.g. ©PªN­Û­ = Jay Chou
 * 
 * Localization:
 * While English-speakers are used to "Tchaikovsky", he is known elsewhere in the world by different spellings
 * e.g. Piotr Ilitch Tchaïkovski = Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky
 * 
 * Transliterations:
 * There are often several ways to transliterate non-Roman characters according to different standards
 * e.g. Jay Chow = Jay Chou
 * 
 * "Translated" Names:
 * Many Asian artists have "English" names in addition to their given "Chinese" or "Japanese" etc. names - 
 * in some cases, the artists prefer the English name even in non-English text
 * e.g. Chou Jie Lun = Jay Chou
 * 
 * Legal Changes:
 * Artists are often forced to change their names for legal reasons, sometimes only in part of the world
 * e.g. Yaz = Yazoo.
